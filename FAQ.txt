BASICloader

FAQ.txt

Why is the output not working on my Commodore machine?

  You need to change the "EXEC" command to "SYS"

What is the preamble?

  Some machines have instructions that can modify the memory map. When
  designing your program, you can use these instructions.

  For example, the Color Computer has the instruction "CLEAR". Extended
  Color BASIC has "PCLEAR", and Disk Extended Color BASIC has "FILES".

  The Commodore 64 has pointers within the first 256 bytes of RAM that
  can be adjusted to ensure that some memory is reserved for your
  program.

I'm having trouble using the output directly with an emulator

  The output of BASICloader is designed to be printed on paper and then
  distributed to users, who would type them in by hand.

  On a modern machine, you can use the output file directly in an
  emulator. If you do, be aware of case sensitivity.

  The filename "typein.bas" might need to be capitalized to work with
  some tools. As to the contents of the file, BASICloader produces
  uppercase output by default, but that can be changed by giving
  --lowercase on the command line.

  VICE (the Commodore emulator) needs lowercase input to work
  properly.

Are there license restrictions on the output of BASICloader?

  Yes. Please ensure that credit is given to me and the BASICloader
  program. Other than that, you can do as you please with the generated
  type-in programs.
